# Contributing to Reservations

Thanks so much for helping with the development of Reservations! This guide will cover the process for helping out with the project and should allow you to get started quickly and easily. If you need any help with contributing, please e-mail `stc-reservations{at}yale{dot}edu` to contact the core team.

## Reporting an Issue
If you've been using Reservations and [notice a bug](#bug-reports), or want to [suggest a new feature](#feature-requests), please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/YaleSTC/reservations/issues/new). Before doing so, however, please **search open / closed issues** to see if someone else has already opened a similar issue.

### Bug Reports
A bug is a *verifiable problem* that is caused by the Reservations code. Good bug reports allow us to quickly identify the root causes of problems and resolve them. Here are some guidelines for submitting bug reports:

1. **Is it a duplicate?** - check to see if the bug has already been reported.
2. **Has it been resolved?** - check if it can be reproduced using the `master` branch or a newer version.
3. **What is the problem?** - see if you can isolate exactly how to reproduce the issue.
4. **Include a screenshot or screencast** - you can use [LICEcap](http://www.cockos.com/licecap/) to capture a screencast and save it as an animated gif.
5. **Tell us all the things** - include as much information as possible (see the template below for a good starting point).
